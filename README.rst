Cloudhands web portal
:::::::::::::::::::::


    Cloudhands is a `Platform as a Service` (PaaS) framework. It gives you the
    software necessary to run a private computing cloud for your business or
    organisation. A key objective is support for multiple back-end providers.

    Cloudhands is a very young project. As of Autumn 2014, it is under
    heavy development and features are added daily. 

    You are welcome to give `cloudhands` a try, but be aware that some parts
    of the codebase lack the test coverage of a finished product. Improvements
    to documentation are ongoing.

Requirements
::::::::::::

This is a sub-package of the cloudhands framework. To use it you need to begin
with the `Cloudhands operations package`_. All instructions are contained there.
